American Sign Language (ASL) Detection System
Project Overview
This project, developed by Datt Patel from the Indian Institute of Information Technology, Surat (IIIT Surat), is an AI-powered system that converts American Sign Language (ASL) gestures into text and speech in real time. It enables seamless communication for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community by bridging the gap between sign language and spoken language.

How It Works
The system follows a structured pipeline to recognize and translate ASL gestures:

Hand Detection & Tracking

Uses MediaPipe to detect and track 21 hand landmarks (key points) in real time.

Works efficiently even in low-light conditions.

Feature Extraction

Extracts x and y coordinates of the 21 landmarks (total 42 features) from each video frame.

Gesture Classification

A Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network classifies hand poses into ASL letters (A-Z).

The model was trained on 87,000+ ASL images and 10,000+ finger-spelling videos for high accuracy.

Sentence Formation

Recognized letters are combined into words and full sentences using natural language processing (NLP).

Speech Conversion

Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS) converts the translated text into natural-sounding speech instantly.

Key Features
 Real-time ASL Recognition â€“ Detects and translates gestures with 95% accuracy.
 Sentence-Level Translation â€“ Goes beyond single letters to interpret full ASL sentences.
 Robust Performance â€“ Works in varying lighting and background conditions.
 Instant Speech Output â€“ Provides low-latency audio feedback for smooth communication.

Technology Stack
ðŸ”¹ Computer Vision â€“ OpenCV, MediaPipe (for hand tracking)
ðŸ”¹ Machine Learning â€“ TensorFlow, Scikit-learn (MLP model training)
ðŸ”¹ Natural Language Processing (NLP) â€“ For sentence formation
ðŸ”¹ Text-to-Speech (TTS) â€“ gTTS (Googleâ€™s TTS engine)
ðŸ”¹ Data Processing â€“ NumPy, Pandas

Future Enhancements
ðŸ”¸ Bidirectional Translation â€“ Adding speech-to-ASL for two-way communication.
ðŸ”¸ Support for Regional Sign Languages â€“ Expanding beyond ASL to other sign languages.
ðŸ”¸ Improved Temporal Modeling â€“ Using LSTMs to better understand continuous signing.
ðŸ”¸ Expanded Vocabulary â€“ Adding more words, phrases, and contextual gestures.
